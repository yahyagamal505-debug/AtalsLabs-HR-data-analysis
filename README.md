# Atals Labs Employee Attrition Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview
This project by **AtlasLabs** analyzes employee attrition to identify what drives employees to leave a company.  
Using **Power BI** and **Power Query**, we built an interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics such as:
- Overall attrition rate  
- Attrition by age, gender, and department  
- Relationship between tenure, education, and attrition  
- Job role and marital status impact on retention  

The dashboard helps HR departments uncover trends, identify risk areas, and make proactive decisions to reduce turnover.

## 🧩 Tools & Techniques
- **Power BI** – For dashboard creation and DAX calculations  
- **Power Query** – For data transformation, cleaning, and modeling  
- **Dataset** – HR employee records (job role, education, tenure, etc.)

## 🚀 Key Insights
- Employees with shorter tenure show higher attrition rates.  
- Sales and HR departments experience the highest turnover.  
- Education level and marital status have a noticeable impact on retention.  
- **Unexpected Insight:** As employee satisfaction increased, productivity actually decreased — a surprising trend observed in the data.  
  - The **highest satisfaction rate** was in **2020**, which also recorded the **lowest productivity** levels.
